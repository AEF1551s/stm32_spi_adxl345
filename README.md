# STM32_i2c_xyz

This is simple excercise for STM32F410RBT6 microcontroller which is part of NUCLEO-F410RB development board.  
The goal is to learn basic principles of SPI using accelerometer module ADXL345.  

This project includes minimal headers for STM32F4xx.  
This project **does not** include any HAL header files.  
&nbsp;  
This project has been configured and generated by CubeIDE. Compiling and flashing is also done by CubeIDE.   

&nbsp;  
# Overview  
## Drivers  
Contains CMSIS drivers for STM32F4xx microcontrollers.  
## Inc  
Contains user defined header files.  
## Src  
Contains user defined source files.  

&nbsp;  
# Prerequisites
## Linux based systems  
* CubeIDE installed. See ` https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html`.  
&nbsp;  
# Build  
Use CubeIDE to build and flash the NUCLEO development board.  

# Dislcaimer  
The values for x, y, z return as 0. Still to fix, or possible ADXL345 module is broken, based on other people experience.

<<<<<<< HEAD
# Dislcaimer  
The values for x, y, z return as 0. Data is being read, and receive and transmit flags are being set. Except the values read are all 0. 
The same module with I2C works as expected.  
Further analysis of code and ADXL345 SPI communication mode is nessecery.
